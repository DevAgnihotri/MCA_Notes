Use these prompts to instruct GitHub Copilot to convert your original file content to the improved, organized version:

1. **Rewrite the syllabus for clarity and structure, focusing only on Artificial Intelligence topics.**

   - Example: "Rewrite the syllabus section to focus only on AI topics, removing Python content."

2. **Group similar previous year questions (PYQs) under thematic headings and mention the section (A, B, C) for each.**

   - Example: "Group all PYQs by topic and add the section letter for each question."

3. **Rewrite the 2017–18 and 2018–19 sections for better readability and consistency.**

   - Example: "Rewrite the 2017–18 and 2018–19 PYQ sections for clarity and format consistency."

4. **Remove any duplicate or irrelevant content, keeping only the most relevant questions and syllabus points.**

   - Example: "Remove duplicate or irrelevant questions and keep only the most relevant ones."

5. **Format the entire file in clean markdown, using headings, bullet points, and clear separation between syllabus and PYQs.**
