/*
 * This class demonstrates the use of the `clone()` method in Java.
 * The `main` method creates instances of the `Book` class, sets their properties,
 * and clones one of the objects to create a new object with the same state.
 *
 * Key Points:
 * - The `clone()` method is used to create a copy of an object.
 * - The `Cloneable` interface must be implemented in the class to allow cloning.
 * - The `throws CloneNotSupportedException` declaration is required because the `clone()` method
 *   in the `Object` class throws this exception if the object being cloned does not implement `Cloneable`.
 *
 * Example of `throws CloneNotSupportedException`:
 * If a class does not implement `Cloneable` and you attempt to call `clone()` on its object:
 * 
 * ```java
 * Object obj = new Object();
 * Object clonedObj = obj.clone(); // This will throw CloneNotSupportedException
 * ```
 * 
 * To avoid this, the class must implement `Cloneable`, and the method invoking `clone()` must either
 * handle the exception using a `try-catch` block or declare it using `throws CloneNotSupportedException`.
