## Intelligent Agents

### Introduction to Intelligent Agents

**What is an intelligent agent? (2022–23, 2017–18, A, B)**

An intelligent agent is something (like a computer program or robot) that can see what is happening around it, think about what to do, and then take actions to reach its goals. For example, a self-driving car is an intelligent agent because it looks at the road, decides where to go, and drives the car.

### Types of Intelligent Agents


**Discuss its Agent types. (2017–18, B)**

Intelligent agents can be classified into several types:

- **Simple Reflex Agents:**  
  These agents act only based on the current situation (percept) and ignore everything that happened before. They follow simple rules like "if the room is hot, turn on the fan."  
  - *Imp words:* Percept, condition-action rule  
  - *Example:* A thermostat senses the temperature and turns the heater on or off.  
  - *How it works:* The agent receives a percept (e.g., temperature), checks it against a set of rules, and immediately performs the corresponding action without considering past events.

- **Model-Based Reflex Agents:**  
  These agents use an internal model to remember what happened before and keep track of the world. This helps them make better decisions when the current percept is not enough.  
  - *Imp words:* Internal state, model of environment  
  - *Example:* A robot vacuum remembers which areas are already clean and decides where to go next.  
  - *How it works:* The agent updates its internal state based on percepts and uses this model to decide actions, allowing it to handle situations where the current percept alone is insufficient.

- **Goal-Based Agents:**  
  These agents make decisions by considering the goals they want to achieve. They plan actions that help them reach their goals, not just react to the current situation.  
  - *Imp words:* Goal, planning  
  - *Example:* A chess-playing program plans moves to win the game.  
  - *How it works:* The agent evaluates possible actions by checking which ones move it closer to its goal, often using search or planning algorithms to select the best sequence of actions.

- **Utility-Based Agents:**  
  These agents choose actions that give them the highest utility (happiness or efficiency). They use a utility function to measure how good each action is and pick the best one.  
  - *Imp words:* Utility function, optimization  
  - *Example:* An automated trading system selects trades to maximize profit.  
  - *How it works:* The agent assigns a utility value to each possible action and selects the one that maximizes its overall utility, balancing multiple goals or preferences.

- **Learning Agents:**  
  These agents get better over time by learning from their experiences. They can change their behavior based on feedback and improve their performance.  
  - *Imp words:* Learning, feedback, experience  
  - *Example:* A recommendation system learns what movies you like and suggests better options.  
  - *How it works:* The agent uses feedback from its actions to update its knowledge or strategy, allowing it to adapt and improve its decisions in future situations.

### Structure of Intelligent Agents

**Name the elements of an agent. (2018–19, A)**

The structure of an intelligent agent typically includes:

- **Sensors:** Devices or software that collect information from the environment.  
  *Example:* A camera on a robot sees objects around it.

- **Actuators:** Parts that let the agent take actions or make changes in the environment.  
  *Example:* Wheels on a robot help it move.

- **Performance Measure:** A way to check how well the agent is doing its job or reaching its goals.  
  *Example:* Counting how much dirt a robot vacuum cleans.

- **Internal Model/State:** Memory or data that helps the agent remember past events or keep track of the environment.  
  *Example:* A robot remembers which rooms it has already cleaned.

- **Decision-Making Logic:** The rules or methods the agent uses to choose what to do next.  
  *Example:* If the robot sees dirt, it decides to clean that spot.


**Describe intelligent agents in terms of Percepts, Actions, Goals and Environment with suitable block diagram and example. (2021–22, C)**

### Intelligent Agents: Percepts, Actions, Goals, and Environment

An intelligent agent is a system that can sense its surroundings, process information, and take actions to achieve specific goals. These agents are designed to operate autonomously and make decisions based on the data they receive from their environment.

#### Key Elements

- **Percepts:**  
  Percepts are the inputs or observations that the agent receives from its environment through sensors. These could be anything the agent can detect, such as temperature, light, sound, or the presence of obstacles.  
  *Example:* A robot vacuum detects dirt or obstacles using its sensors.

- **Actions:**  
  Actions are the outputs or moves the agent performs in response to its percepts. The agent uses actuators to interact with the environment, such as moving, cleaning, or turning.  
  *Example:* The robot vacuum moves to a dirty spot and cleans it.

- **Goals:**  
  Goals are the desired outcomes or objectives that the agent tries to achieve. The agent’s behavior is guided by these goals, which help it decide which actions to take.  
  *Example:* The goal of the robot vacuum is to keep the floor clean.

- **Environment:**  
  The environment is everything outside the agent that it interacts with. It provides the context in which the agent operates and can affect the agent’s percepts and actions.  
  *Example:* The robot vacuum operates in a home environment, which may have furniture, rooms, and people.

#### How Intelligent Agents Work

1. **Sensing:** The agent uses sensors to gather information (percepts) from the environment.
2. **Decision Making:** The agent processes the percepts, considers its goals, and decides on the best action using its internal logic or algorithms.
3. **Acting:** The agent performs actions using actuators to change or affect the environment.
4. **Feedback Loop:** The agent continuously senses the environment, updates its knowledge, and adjusts its actions to better achieve its goals.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### What is Natural Language Processing? (2021–22, A)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that helps computers understand and work with human language, like English, Hindi, or any other spoken or written language.

NLP allows computers to read, listen, and even talk to people in a way that feels natural. It combines ideas from linguistics (the study of language), computer science, and machine learning.

**Key Points about NLP:**
- **Understanding Language:** NLP helps computers figure out what words and sentences mean, even if people use slang or make mistakes.
- **Interpreting Text and Speech:** Computers can read emails, messages, or listen to voice commands and understand what the user wants.
- **Generating Language:** NLP lets computers write sentences, answer questions, or translate languages.
- **Learning from Data:** NLP systems get better as they see more examples of language, so they can handle new words or phrases.

**Examples of NLP in Daily Life:**
- Chatbots that answer questions online
- Voice assistants like Siri or Alexa
- Google Translate for changing one language to another
- Spell check and grammar correction in word processors

**Why is NLP Important?**
- It makes it easier for people to interact with computers using everyday language.
- It helps businesses understand customer feedback, emails, and social media posts.
- It allows for faster and more accurate translation between languages.

In summary, NLP is what makes computers smart enough to understand and use human language, making technology more helpful and user-friendly.

### Key Approaches in NLP

**Explain various approaches in NLP. (2023–24, C)**

- **Rule-Based Approaches:** These methods use a set of predefined grammar rules and dictionaries to process and understand language. The system follows these rules to analyze sentences, identify parts of speech, and extract meaning.  
  - *Example:* Early translation systems used rules to convert English sentences to French by matching grammar patterns.
  - *Advantages:* Good for well-defined tasks and languages with clear grammar.
  - *Limitations:* Hard to handle exceptions, slang, or complex sentences.

- **Statistical Approaches:** These methods use probability and statistics to analyze large amounts of language data. They look for patterns and relationships between words based on how often they appear together.  
  - *Example:* Spam filters use statistical models to detect common words and phrases in spam emails.
  - *Advantages:* Can handle variations and uncertainty in language.
  - *Limitations:* Needs lots of data and may miss rare or new language patterns.

- **Machine Learning Approaches:** These methods train computer models on huge datasets to learn language patterns automatically. The models improve as they see more examples, allowing them to understand context, meaning, and even emotions.  
  - *Example:* Chatbots like ChatGPT use machine learning to answer questions and hold conversations.
  - *Advantages:* Can handle complex tasks, adapt to new data, and improve over time.
  - *Limitations:* Requires large datasets and computing power; may sometimes make mistakes or misunderstand context.

### Steps Involved in Natural Language Processing (NLP)

**Explain various steps involved in natural language processing. (2022–23, C)**

Each step helps a computer understand a sentence better. Let's use the example sentence: **"AI is amazing!"** and see how it is processed:

1. **Tokenization:**  
  *Definition:* Tokenization is the process of splitting a sentence into smaller pieces called tokens, such as words or punctuation marks.  
  *Example:*  
  `["AI", "is", "amazing", "!"]`

2. **Part-of-Speech Tagging:**  
  *Definition:* Part-of-speech tagging assigns a grammatical role (like noun, verb, adjective) to each token in the sentence.  
  *Example:*  
  - "AI" → noun  
  - "is" → verb  
  - "amazing" → adjective  
  - "!" → punctuation

3. **Parsing:**  
  *Definition:* Parsing analyzes the grammatical structure of the sentence to find relationships between words, such as subject and predicate.  
  *Example:*  
  - "AI" is the subject  
  - "is" is the verb  
  - "amazing" describes "AI"

4. **Semantic Analysis:**  
  *Definition:* Semantic analysis is understanding the actual meaning of the sentence and what each word or phrase refers to.  
  *Example:*  
  - "AI" means artificial intelligence  
  - "amazing" shows a positive quality about AI

5. **Sentiment Analysis:**  
  *Definition:* Sentiment analysis detects the emotion or feeling expressed in the sentence, such as positive, negative, or neutral.  
  *Example:*  
  - The sentence expresses a **positive** sentiment

**Summary Table:**

| Step                  | What it does                              | Example Output                |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
