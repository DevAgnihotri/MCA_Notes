### 🔹 Definition

**Pattern Recognition (PR)** is the process of automatically identifying and classifying patterns or regularities in data using computational methods.
A **pattern** is an *object, signal, or data structure* that can be represented by a set of features.
➡️ **Example:** In handwriting recognition, the shape of a letter (e.g., ‘A’ or ‘B’) is the pattern.

### 🔹 Components of a Pattern Recognition System

1. **Sensing / Data Acquisition:** Collecting raw data (e.g., image, sound, text).
2. **Preprocessing:** Cleaning or normalizing data (e.g., noise removal).
3. **Feature Extraction:** Selecting the most relevant features that represent data efficiently.
4. **Classification / Decision Making:** Assigning patterns to specific categories using algorithms (like decision trees, SVMs, neural networks).
5. **Post-processing / Evaluation:** Assessing performance, accuracy, and refinement.

---

### 🔹 Design Principles of a PR System

1. **Representation of Patterns:** Properly defining feature sets that best describe the patterns.
2. **Feature Selection:** Reducing dimensionality by keeping only useful features.
3. **Model Selection:** Choosing appropriate classification models (statistical, neural, fuzzy).
4. **Training and Learning:** Adjusting parameters based on training data.
5. **Evaluation:** Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

## **2️⃣ Statistical Pattern Recognition**

- 2024 — Section A (Q1(i)): What is Statistical PR?


### 🔹 Definition
Ahh 👍 got it — you mean **SPR = Statistical Pattern Recognition** (not State Space).

Here is a **super simple explanation**, exactly exam-oriented 👇

---

### **SPR (Statistical Pattern Recognition) — Super Simple**

**SPR** is a method where a computer **recognizes patterns using statistics and probability**.

👉 It looks at data, finds patterns using **math**, and then **classifies** or **predicts** something.

**SPR = Learn patterns from data using probability**

---

### How SPR works (easy)

1. Data is collected (images, sounds, numbers, etc.)
2. Important features are extracted
3. Statistical methods are applied
4. Probability is calculated
5. Pattern is classified or recognized

---

### Simple example 🎤

**Speech Recognition**

* Input: voice
* Features: sound frequencies
* Statistics: probability of sounds
* Output: recognized word

---

### Where SPR is used

* Speech recognition
* Face recognition
* Handwritten character recognition
* Medical diagnosis

## **3️⃣ Parameter Estimation Methods — PCA & LDA**

- 2022 — Section B (Q2(e)): Explain Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).  
- 2023 — Section C (Q7(b)): Explain need and concept of principal component analysis in pattern recognition process.  
- 2024 — Section C (Q7(a)): Define Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Write steps involved in making principal components to do a classification of given data.


### 🔸 (A) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**Concept:**
PCA is a *dimensionality reduction* technique that transforms data into a new coordinate system such that:

* The first principal component captures the maximum variance.
* Subsequent components capture remaining variance, orthogonal to previous ones.

**Steps to Compute PCA:**

1. Standardize the data.
2. Compute covariance matrix of features.
3. Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
4. Sort eigenvectors by decreasing eigenvalues.
5. Form principal components by projecting data on top *k* eigenvectors.

**Use in Pattern Recognition:**

* Reduces dimensionality while retaining key features.
* Simplifies classification (e.g., face recognition, image compression).

---

### 🔸 (B) Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

**Concept:**
LDA finds a **linear combination of features** that best separates two or more classes.
Unlike PCA (which focuses on variance), LDA focuses on **class separability**.

**Steps:**

1. Compute within-class and between-class scatter matrices.
2. Find the transformation that maximizes between-class scatter and minimizes within-class scatter.
3. Project data on the new axis for better classification.

**Mathematical Objective:**
[
W = \arg \max \frac{|S_B|}{|S_W|}
]
where (S_B) = between-class scatter, (S_W) = within-class scatter.

**Use in PR:**

* Enhances class discrimination in recognition tasks like face or object identification.

| Feature                  | PCA                        | LDA                         |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Basis                    | Unsupervised               | Supervised                  |
| Goal                     | Maximize variance          | Maximize class separability |
| Depends on class labels? | No                         | Yes                         |
| Applications             | Compression, visualization | Classification, recognition |

---

### 🔹 Relationship to Pattern Recognition

Both **PCA and LDA** serve as **feature extraction / dimensionality reduction tools** in the **design cycle** of a PR system before classification.

## **1️⃣ Classification Techniques — Nearest Neighbor Rule and Bayes Classifier**

- 2023 — Section A (Q1(j)): State nearest neighbor rule.  
- 2022 — Section C (Q7(b)): Show how classification is done by k‑nearest neighbors. Construct KNN on given dataset and predict class for X (p1=4, p2=6), k=3.  
- 2024 — Section C (Q7(b)): Explain Nearest Neighbor (NN) rule in detail.  
- Bayes classifier: No matching questions found in the provided selection.

### 🔹 What is Classification?

Classification is the process of assigning a data sample (unknown pattern) to one of the predefined classes based on features.
It is a **supervised learning** method because the model is trained with labeled data.

## ⭐ **1. Nearest Neighbor Rule (K-NN)**

### ✅ **Definition**

K-Nearest Neighbor is a **classification technique** where you classify a new data point by looking at the **closest (nearest) existing points**.

### ⚙️ **How it works**

1. Take the new point.
2. Find its **K nearest neighbors** from the dataset.
3. Whichever class appears the most, that becomes the new point’s class.

---

### 📈 **ASCII Diagram**

```
Class A (●)          Class B (▲)

●       ●
   ●      
             ▲     ▲
                  ▲

New Point (X)

           X
```

X will be classified depending on whether more **●** or **▲** are close to it.

---

### 🧪 **Simple Working Example**

Dataset:

| Point | X | Y | Class |
| ----- | - | - | ----- |
| P1    | 1 | 1 | A     |
| P2    | 2 | 1 | A     |
| P3    | 8 | 8 | B     |
| P4    | 9 | 8 | B     |

Predict for: **(3,2)**
Choose **K = 3**

Distances:

* To P1 → close
* To P2 → very close
* To P3 → far
* To P4 → far

Nearest neighbors = **A, A, B → majority A**

➡️ **Final Class = A**

---

## ⭐ **2. Bayes Classifier (Naïve Bayes)**

### ✅ **Definition**

Bayes classifier predicts class based on **probability**.

Formula used:

[
P(Class | Data) = \frac{P(Data | Class) \cdot P(Class)}{P(Data)}
]

We choose the class with the **highest probability**.

---

### 🧠 **Simple Example**

You want to classify a message as:

* Spam
* Not Spam

Training data:

* 80% emails are **not spam**
* 20% emails are **spam**
* The word “Offer” appears:

  * In **60%** spam
  * In **10%** non-spam

New email contains the word **“Offer”**.
Compare probabilities:

```
P(Spam | Offer)     = 0.6 × 0.2 = 0.12
P(NotSpam | Offer)  = 0.1 × 0.8 = 0.08
```

Since **0.12 > 0.08** → classify as **Spam**.

---

### 📈 **ASCII Diagram**

```
 ┌─────────────── Bayes Classifier ────────────────┐
 |   Input Word: "Offer"                           |
 |   Calculate:                                     |
 |     P(Spam|Offer)                                |
 |     P(NotSpam|Offer)                             |
 |   Compare and choose highest.                    |
 └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## ⭐ **3. K-Means Clustering**

### ✅ **Definition**

K-means is **unsupervised**, meaning **no labels**.
It groups data into **K clusters** based on similarity.

---

### ⚙️ **How K-Means works**

1. Pick number of clusters **K**
2. Randomly place **K centroids**
3. Assign each point to nearest centroid
4. Move centroids
5. Repeat until stable

---

### 📈 **ASCII Diagram**

```

○ = centroid


After Clustering:

Cluster 1 (○1):
● ● ● ●

Cluster 2 (●2):
▲ ▲ ▲ ▲
```

---

### 🧪 **Working Example**

Points:
(1,1), (2,1), (1,2), (9,9), (10,9), (9,10)

Choose **K = 2**

Group 1 (near 1,1):
(1,1), (2,1), (1,2)

Group 2 (near 9,9):
(9,9), (10,9), (9,10)

➡️ **Clusters formed successfully**

---

## ⭐ **4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

### ✅ **Definition**

SVM is a classifier that finds the **best boundary (hyperplane)** between classes.
It tries to maximize the **margin** (distance) between boundary and points.

---

### 📈 **ASCII Diagram of SVM**

```
Class A (●) on left
Class B (▲) on right

●   ●   ●   |   ▲   ▲   ▲
             |
         Max Margin
             |
●   ●   ●   |   ▲   ▲   ▲
```

The **middle vertical line** is the SVM decision boundary.

---

### 🧪 **Simple Working Example**

Dataset:

| X | Y | Class |
| - | - | ----- |
| 1 | 1 | A     |
| 1 | 2 | A     |
| 2 | 1 | A     |
| 9 | 9 | B     |
| 8 | 9 | B     |
| 9 | 8 | B     |

SVM finds a “line” between the two classes (A and B).

Imagine two groups far apart → SVM draws the **best separation line** exactly in between.

➡️ New point (7,7) → on B's side → **Class B**

### 🔹 Concept

SVM is a **supervised learning algorithm** used for **classification** (and sometimes regression).
It finds the **optimal hyperplane** that separates classes with the **maximum margin**.

---

### 🔹 Key Idea

For binary classification:
[
w \cdot x + b = 0
]
is the decision boundary (hyperplane).
SVM aims to maximize the margin = distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points (called **support vectors**).

---

### 🔹 Diagram (text form)

```
Class + : o o o | Margin |  | Margin | x x x : Class –
                <-------> max margin
```

---

### 🔹 Types

1. **Linear SVM** – when data is linearly separable.
2. **Non-linear SVM** – uses **kernel trick** to project data into higher dimensions:

   * Polynomial kernel
   * Gaussian (RBF) kernel
   * Sigmoid kernel

---

### 🔹 Advantages

* Works well in high-dimensional spaces.
* Robust to overfitting (especially with regularization).
* Effective for both linear and non-linear data.

### 🔹 Applications

* Text and image classification
* Bioinformatics (gene classification)
* Handwriting recognition
