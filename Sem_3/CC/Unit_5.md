# ☁️ **Google App Engine (GAE)**

- Google App Engine (GAE): major cloud features, architecture, and programming environment (2021 Q5(a), 2023 Q7(b), 2024 Q7(a))

## 🔹 **Introduction**

**Google App Engine (GAE)** is a **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** offering by **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.
It allows **developers to build, deploy, and scale web applications** automatically without managing the underlying hardware, servers, or networking.

> Simply put, you focus on your *application code*, and **Google handles everything else** — from deployment to scaling and monitoring.

---

## ⚙️ **Main Concept**

GAE provides a **fully managed environment** where developers can upload applications written in supported programming languages.
Once deployed, GAE automatically:

* Allocates resources,
* Manages scaling (up or down),
* Balances load,
* Monitors performance, and
* Ensures high availability.

This makes it ideal for **startups, developers, and enterprises** who want to build web apps without managing infrastructure.

---

## 🏗️ **Architecture of Google App Engine**

GAE is structured in **four major layers** that work together to deliver a cloud platform:

| **Layer**                    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                          |
| :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1️⃣ Application Layer**    | This is the top layer where user-developed apps run. These apps are written in supported languages such as Python, Java, Go, PHP, and Node.js.                           |
| **2️⃣ Services Layer**       | Provides built-in services like Datastore (NoSQL DB), Task Queue, Mail, Memcache, and User Authentication APIs. These are ready-to-use components for app functionality. |
| **3️⃣ Runtime Environment**  | A secure “sandbox” that isolates each app so it cannot access the underlying OS or other apps. It enforces security and resource limits (CPU, memory, etc.).             |
| **4️⃣ Infrastructure Layer** | Managed entirely by Google — includes servers, data centers, load balancers, and networking that host and run all GAE apps worldwide.                                    |

---

## 🔸 **Key Features of Google App Engine**
