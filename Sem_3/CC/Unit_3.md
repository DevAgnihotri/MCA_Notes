| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition                 | Managed services for structured/semi-structured data (e.g., Firestore, DynamoDB, RDS). | Early schema-less key–attribute store for small–medium datasets. |
| Data model                 |                                Flexible: key‑value, document, relational, wide‑column. | Schema‑less items with attributes.                               |
| Queries                    |                    Rich queries, indexes, filtering, aggregation (depends on product). | Limited SQL‑like SELECT; fewer operators.                        |
| Transactions & consistency |                                  Many support ACID or configurable strong consistency. | No multi‑item ACID; typically eventual consistency.              |
| Scalability & perf         |                              Built for large scale, auto‑scaling, predictable latency. | Suitable for modest workloads; not for very high throughput.     |
| Indexing                   |                                      Configurable primary/secondary/composite indexes. | Basic attribute indexing; limited control.                       |
| Use cases                  |                                            OLTP, analytics, large web/mobile backends. | Simple lookups, small metadata stores, lightweight apps.         |
| Availability & ops         |                       Managed SLAs, multi‑region options, modern operational features. | Managed by AWS but feature‑limited vs newer services.            |
| Cost model                 |                                            Varies (provisioned/usage/storage pricing). | Pay‑per‑use; may be less cost‑effective at scale.                |

#### Limitations of SimpleDB

- Limited query expressiveness and fewer filter/aggregation capabilities than modern datastores.
- No full multi-item ACID transactions; constrained consistency model (eventual consistency for many operations).
- Restricted indexing options and less control over query performance tuning.
- Not optimized for very large datasets or very high throughput; scaling is more limited compared to newer services (e.g., DynamoDB, Cloud Datastore).
- Item and domain size/limits exist (practical limits on attributes and item size).
- Fewer advanced features (backup/restore, fine-grained security controls, analytics integrations) compared to contemporary managed datastores.
- AWS recommends newer services for most production workloads; SimpleDB is suitable mainly for simple, lightweight use cases.
