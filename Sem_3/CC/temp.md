Topics with no explicit exam questions found (in this dataset)
- HLL VM (High-Level-Language VM) — no direct questions.
- System VM — no explicit question labeled "System VM" (covered indirectly via hardware/server virtualization).

If you want, I can produce a condensed study checklist per topic with only the exact question texts and year tags.
