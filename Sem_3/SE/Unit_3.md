### ✳️ What is Software Design?

Software design is a process to transform user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation.

It involves the **process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and data** for a software system to satisfy specified requirements.
It bridges the gap between **requirements specification** and **implementation**.

---

### 🧱 Levels of Software Design

There are **three main levels**:

1. **Architectural Design:**

   * Defines the system structure — major modules and their relationships.
   * Output: **Architecture diagram**.
2. **High-Level Design (HLD):**

   * Describes module-level functionality and interfaces.
   * Defines how modules interact.
3. **Low-Level Design (LLD):**

   * Focuses on internal logic, algorithms, and data structures of individual modules.

---

### ⚙️ Principles of Good Software Design

1. **Modularity:** Divide system into manageable components.
2. **Abstraction:** Focus on essential features, hide complexity.
3. **Encapsulation:** Keep data and logic safe within modules.
4. **Cohesion & Coupling:** Aim for **high cohesion**, **low coupling**.
5. **Simplicity:** Avoid unnecessary complexity, while desinging the softawre
6. **Reusability:** Encourage reuse of components.
7. **Maintainability:** Design for easy modification.

---

### 🧩 Design Concepts

* **Design Model:** A representation of software from different viewpoints — data, architecture, interface, and components.

### **Elements of Design Model**

1. **Data Design** — It shows how data is arranged, stored, and used in the system. It helps in planning how information will move between different parts of the program. Proper data design makes it easier to handle and update the data whenever required.

2. **Architectural Design** — It explains the overall structure or layout of the software. This design shows how different modules are linked and how they work together to form the complete system. It acts as a guide for developers to build the system in a clear and organized way.

3. **Interface Design** — It defines how users and system components will communicate with each other. This design helps in creating a smooth connection between user and system. A good interface makes it easier for users to use the system.

4. **Component-Level Design** — It focuses on the inner details of each part of the software. It describes what each component will do and how it will perform its task. This helps in breaking the system into smaller units that are easier to develop, test, and maintain.

5. **Procedural Design** — It explains the step-by-step working of the program. This design helps to show the order in which tasks are done to get the final output. It makes the coding process simple and helps developers understand the exact flow of operations.
---

## 🏗️ **2. Architectural Design**

- Differentiate architectural design and procedural design. [2024, Section C Q5(b)]

### 🧠 Definition

Architectural design is the **blueprint of the software system** that defines major components and their interaction.
It answers **“What are the main parts and how do they work together?”**

It explains the overall structure or layout of the software. This design shows how different modules are linked and how they work together to form the complete system. It acts as a guide for developers to build the system in a clear and organized way.

## ⚙️ **3. Low-Level Design — Modularization**

- What are the advantages of Modularization? [2021, Section A (j)]
- What do you mean by function oriented design? Discuss the advantages of modular system. [2020, Section C Q5(a)]

Detailed design deals with the implementation part of sub-systems in the previous two designs.

It is more detailed towards modules and their implementations. It defines logical structure of each module and their interfaces to communicate with other modules.

### 🧩 What is Modularization?

**Modularization** is the process of **dividing a system into smaller, independent modules** that can be developed and tested separately.

Modularization is a technique to divide a software system into multiple discrete and independent modules, which are expected to be capable of carrying out task(s) independently.
---

### ✅ Advantages of Modularization

1. **Simplicity:** Each module is easier to work with.
2. **Reusability:** Modules can be reused in other projects.
3. **Maintainability:** Easy to isolate and fix bugs.
4. **Parallel Development:** Teams can work on different modules simultaneously.
5. **Scalability:** System can be easily expanded.
6. **Testing Ease:** Each module can be unit tested separately.

---

### 🧩Coupling & Cohesion (2024 — Q5(b))

- What is meant by the term cohesion in the context of software design? [2024, Section C Q5(b)]

When a software program is modularized, its tasks are divided into several modules based on some characteristics.

There are measures by which the quality of a design of modules and their interaction among each other can be measured. These measures are called coupling and cohesion.

**Coupling** means how much one module in a software system depends on another.
It shows the level of connection between modules.
If coupling is high, modules depend too much on each other.
If coupling is low, modules work more independently, which is better for software design.

![Coupling Illustration](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5612AQE3VK4whXDp9w/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1520234740041?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=K-dNJioqi7OjATK0NFaSDh4G7TE6lBw7wi-bKVluqBQ)

| **Type of Coupling**                             | **Explanation (Easy and Clear)**                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Content Coupling**                          | In **content coupling**, one module directly uses or changes the content of another module. This makes them tightly connected, and any change in one can break the other.                |
| **2. Common Coupling**                           | In **common coupling**, two or more modules share the same common data or global variables. Because of this shared data, changing one module’s value can affect all others using it.     |
| **3. External Coupling**                         | **External coupling** happens when modules depend on external systems like files, devices, or communication links. If the external part changes, the modules may stop working correctly. |
| **4. Control Coupling**                          | In **control coupling**, one module controls the behavior of another by passing control information like flags or commands. The control of one module depends on another.                |
| **5. Stamp Coupling (Data-Structured Coupling)** | **Stamp coupling** means that modules share a data structure or record, but each module only uses part of it. So, they are linked through a common structured group of data.             |
| **6. Data Coupling**                             | **Data coupling** occurs when modules share only necessary data through parameters. It is the best type of coupling because modules stay independent and easy to modify.                 |

#### Cohesion

**Cohesion** means how closely the elements or parts inside a single module are related to each other.
It shows how well the tasks within a module work together to perform one purpose.
Higher cohesion is good because it means the module does one clear job.
Lower cohesion is bad because the module tries to do many unrelated things.

![module_cohesion](https://cdn.botpenguin.com/assets/website/software_engineering_coupling_and_cohesion7_d0cacade52.webp)

| **Type of Cohesion**            | **Explanation (Easy and Clear)**                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Coincidental Cohesion**    | In **coincidental cohesion**, the elements in a module are grouped randomly without any proper relation. The tasks do not depend on each other and are just placed together. |
| **2. Logical Cohesion**         | **Logical cohesion** happens when elements in a module perform similar types of tasks, like input or output operations, but are chosen by control flags or conditions.       |
| **3. Temporal Cohesion**        | In **temporal cohesion**, elements are grouped because they are executed at the same time. For example, tasks done during program start-up or shutdown belong together.      |
| **4. Procedural Cohesion**      | **Procedural cohesion** means the elements are grouped because they follow a specific sequence of execution. The tasks are related by order, not by the same purpose.        |
| **5. Communicational Cohesion** | In **communicational cohesion**, elements work on the same data or contribute to the same output. They are grouped because they share common data.                           |
| **6. Sequential Cohesion**      | **Sequential cohesion** means the output of one element becomes the input for another element in the same module. The tasks are connected in a clear sequence.               |
| **7. Functional Cohesion**      | **Functional cohesion** is the best type of cohesion. It means all elements in the module work together to perform one single, well-defined function.                        |

## 🧩 **2. Coupling and Cohesion Measures**

- Explain various types of coupling with the help of an example. [2020, Section C Q5(b)]
- Explain the types of coupling and cohesion. [2021, Section B (d)]
- Define Cohesion. What is Functional Cohesion? Does Functional Cohesion within a module bring about good software design? Give an example. What type of coupling and cohesion is preferred? [2023, Section C Q5(a)]
- What is meant by the term cohesion in the context of software design? [2024, Section C Q5(b)]

### 🧠 Cohesion

Cohesion measures **how strongly elements within a module are related**.

* **High Cohesion:** Module focuses on a single task → desirable.
* **Low Cohesion:** Module performs unrelated functions → undesirable.

**Types of Cohesion (lowest → highest):**

1. **Coincidental:** Random tasks grouped together.
2. **Logical:** Similar category of actions (e.g., input/output).
3. **Temporal:** Related by time (e.g., initialization).
4. **Procedural:** Related by control sequence.
5. **Communicational:** Use same data set.
6. **Sequential:** Output of one part is input to another.
7. **Functional:** One single, well-defined task → ✅ **Best type**.

👉 **Example:**
A function that only calculates and returns the area of a circle = **functional cohesion**.

---

### ⚙️ Coupling

Coupling measures **how dependent modules are on each other**.

* **Low Coupling:** Modules communicate minimally → desirable.
* **High Coupling:** Modules heavily depend on each other → undesirable.

**Types of Coupling (highest → lowest):**

1. **Content Coupling:** One module modifies another’s data or logic (worst).
2. **Common Coupling:** Shared global data.
3. **External Coupling:** Shared external data format or device.
4. **Control Coupling:** Module passes control info to another.
5. **Stamp Coupling:** Passes data structures, not individual elements.
6. **Data Coupling:** Passes only necessary data → ✅ **Best type**.

---

### ✅ Preferred Design

* **Cohesion:** High (Functional Cohesion preferred)
* **Coupling:** Low (Data Coupling preferred)

👉 **Functional Cohesion leads to a good modular design** — as it improves maintainability, reliability, and reusability.

👉 Use formulas with the given operator/operand counts.

---

## ⚙️ **2. Function Point (FP) Based Measures**

### 💡 Definition

**Function Point (FP)** is a **functionality-oriented metric** used to measure the **size of software** based on the **features delivered to the user**, not lines of code.

Developed by **Allan Albrecht (IBM)**, it focuses on **what the software does**, not how it’s implemented.

---

### 📊 **Five Major Components**

| **Component**                         | **Description**                | **Example**       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **1. External Inputs (EI)**           | User inputs that update data   | Forms, data entry |
| **2. External Outputs (EO)**          | Outputs generated              | Reports, messages |
| **3. External Inquiries (EQ)**        | Input-output combinations      | Search forms      |

| **5. External Interface Files (EIF)** | Shared data with other systems | Linked databases  |

---

### 🧾 **Computation Steps**

1. **Identify & Count** the above five components.
2. **Assign Weights** (low, average, high complexity).
3. **Calculate Unadjusted Function Points (UFP):**
   [
   UFP = \sum (\text{count of each component × its weight})
   ]
4. **Calculate Value Adjustment Factor (VAF):**
   [
   VAF = 0.65 + 0.01 × \sum (\text{complexity adjustment values})
   ]
5. **Final Function Points (FP):**
   [
   FP = UFP × VAF
   ]

---

### 💬 **Advantages**

* Independent of programming language.
* Measures user functionality.
* Useful for **early estimation** before coding starts.

---

### 📘 **Example**

A system with:

* 10 Inputs (avg weight = 4)
* 5 Outputs (avg weight = 5)
* 2 Files (avg weight = 10)

Then,
UFP = (10×4) + (5×5) + (2×10) = 40 + 25 + 20 = **85 FP**

---

## 🧮 **3. Cyclomatic Complexity (CC)**

### 💡 Definition

Cyclomatic Complexity is a **control flow-based metric** proposed by **Thomas McCabe**.
It measures the **number of linearly independent paths** in a program.

👉 **It indicates the logical complexity of a program.**

---

### 📊 **Formula**

[
V(G) = E - N + 2P
]
where:

* **E =** Number of edges in Control Flow Graph
* **N =** Number of nodes in Control Flow Graph
* **P =** Number of connected components (usually 1 for a single function)

---

### 🧠 **Alternate Method**

Count the **number of decision points (like if, while, for, case)**:
[
V(G) = \text{Number of decision nodes} + 1
]

---

### 🧾 **Example**

```c
if (a > b)
   x = a;
else
   x = b;
printf("%d", x);
```

👉 There is 1 decision point →
Cyclomatic Complexity = 1 + 1 = **2**

### 📈 **Interpretation**

| **Cyclomatic Complexity** | **Meaning**         | **Remarks**              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1 – 10                    | Simple, low risk    | ✅ Easy to test           |
| 11 – 20                   | Moderate complexity | ⚠️ Needs careful testing |
| 21 – 50                   | Complex             | ❌ Hard to test           |
| > 50                      | Very complex        | 🚫 Re-design needed      |

### 📘 **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**

A **graphical representation** of the control flow of a program:

* **Nodes** → Statements or blocks of code
* **Edges** → Control paths between them

Helps in **visualizing program logic** and **calculating CC**.

---

### 🧩 **Importance**

* Identifies complex areas of code.
* Helps in **unit testing and debugging**.
* Reduces risk of logical errors.
* Guides **modular design** decisions.
