## ðŸ“š Topic-wise Grouped Questions (Unit 2)

### ðŸ”¸ Error Detection & Correction

* What is cyclic code and explain Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) code? *(2019, Section B)*
* A bit stream 10011101 is transmitted using the standard CRC method. The generator polynomial is x^3 + 1. Show the actual bit string transmitted. Suppose the third bit from the left is inverted during transmission. Show that this error is detected at the receiverâ€™s end. *(2023, Section B)*
* List out various error detection techniques? Discuss Hamming code with suitable example. *(2021, Section C)*
* What do you mean error handling at data link layer? Discuss Hamming code with suitable example. *(2023, Section C)*

### ðŸ”¸ Flow & Error Control

* Discuss sliding window-based flow control techniques at data link layer. *(2021, Section C)*
* Explain Selective Reject and Go-Back-N ARQ with reference to sliding window protocol. *(2023, Section C)*
* What is the maximum window size for data transmission using the selective reject protocol with n-bit frame sequence numbers? *(2021, Section A)*

### ðŸ”¸ Channel Allocation Protocols

* What do you mean by ALOHA? Consider a situation, where a large population of ALOHA users manages to generate 50 requests/sec, including both originals and retransmissions. Time is slotted in units of 40 msec.
    - (a) What are the chances of success on the first attempt?
    - (b) What is the probability of exactly k collisions and then a success?
    - (c) What is the expected number of transmission attempts needed? *(2021, Section B)*
* Discuss CSMA/CD. *(2023, Section A)*
* Define controlled access and list three protocols in this category. *(2019, Section C)*
